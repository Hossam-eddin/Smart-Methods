In this section I will write down #Explaination followed by the code below it:
p.s: This code should be written in the python file that you create with the file extention: 'name'.py



#Starting with importing opencv
import cv2

# Loading the cascade file
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Read the input image >>> if your image's name is 'test'
img = cv2.imread('test.jpg')

# Convert into grayscale >>> as the detection works only on grayscale images, So it is important to convert the image's color into grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect faces  >>> 'gray' is your input image, '1.1' is the 'scaleFactor', while '4' is the 'minNeighbours' >>> you will need to change those values to get detection.
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)

# Drawing a rectangle around the face
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
    
# Displaying the output
cv2.imshow('img', img)
cv2.waitKey()



Additional info:
>>ScaleFactor is a parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale.
  Suppose, the scale factor is 1.03, it means we're using a small step for resizing,
  i.e. reduce size by 3 %, we increase the chance of a matching size with the model for detection.

>>MinNeighbors is a parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it. 
  This parameter will affect the quality of the detected faces: higher value results in less detections but with higher quality.
  
  In the code I kept changing both those scales until I got the right detection.
